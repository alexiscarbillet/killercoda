# Process Management & Resource Limits

In this scenario, you will learn how to diagnose, manage, and mitigate runaway processes that consume excessive CPU or memory.  

As a system administrator or Kubernetes operator, it's important to quickly identify and handle resource-hogging processes to keep the system stable.  

You will practice:
- Inspecting running processes with `ps`, `top`, and `htop`
- Identifying high CPU and memory consumers
- Terminating runaway processes safely
- Applying resource limits with `ulimit`, `nice`, and `renice`

---

âš¡ **Scenario Setup:**  
Some simulated runaway processes have been started in the background:  
- `yes` (infinite CPU usage)  
- `dd` (large memory usage)  
- An infinite `while` loop (CPU hog)  

Your task is to diagnose and fix the system by controlling or terminating these processes.
