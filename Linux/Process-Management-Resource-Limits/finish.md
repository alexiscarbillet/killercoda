# ðŸŽ‰ Scenario Complete

Well done! You successfully diagnosed and managed runaway processes.

âœ… You practiced:
- Viewing processes with `ps` and `top`  
- Identifying high CPU and memory consumers  
- Terminating processes with `kill` and `pkill`  
- Using `ulimit`, `nice`, and `renice` to control resource usage  

---

ðŸš€ **Key Takeaways:**
- Always identify processes before killing them to avoid impacting critical services.  
- Use `nice`/`renice` to adjust CPU priority instead of outright killing a process when possible.  
- Apply `ulimit` to prevent processes from consuming too many resources in the first place.

Next time you encounter a system slowdown, youâ€™ll know exactly how to investigate and take action!
