# Step 4: Verify the Job Runs

Check the visible status file:

```bash
cat ~/backup_status.txt
```

You should see lines like:

```bash
Sat Sep 18 21:37:00 UTC 2025 - Backup completed
Sat Sep 18 21:38:00 UTC 2025 - Backup completed
```

The cron job is now running correctly, and you can visibly see the results.
