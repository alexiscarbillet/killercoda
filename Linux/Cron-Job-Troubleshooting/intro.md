# Cron Job Troubleshooting

In this scenario, a scheduled cron job is supposed to run every 5 minutes and write to `/var/log/backup.log`.  
Unfortunately, the job is broken and never runs.

You will learn how to:
- Check existing cron jobs
- Inspect cron logs for errors
- Fix misconfigured cron entries
- Verify that jobs execute correctly

âš¡ The environment has a misconfigured cron job already installed for you.
