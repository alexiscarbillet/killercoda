# ðŸŽ‰ Scenario Complete

Well done! You successfully diagnosed and fixed a broken cron job.

âœ… You practiced:
- Listing cron jobs with `crontab -l`
- Checking cron logs in `/var/log/syslog` (or `journalctl -u cron`)
- Fixing syntax errors and environment issues
- Verifying job execution in `/var/log/backup.log`

ðŸš€ **Key Takeaways:**
- Cron does not run with the same environment variables as your shell. Always use absolute paths.
- Check system logs (`/var/log/syslog`, `journalctl`) if jobs donâ€™t run.
- Use `crontab -e` to edit jobs and `crontab -l` to verify them.

Next time a scheduled task fails silently, youâ€™ll know where to look first!
