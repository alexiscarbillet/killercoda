# Linux Systemd Service Debugging

In this scenario, you’ll practice working with **systemd services**.  
You’ll create a custom service, attempt to start it, debug why it fails, and fix it so it runs successfully.

This exercise will help you get comfortable with:
- Writing custom systemd unit files.
- Using `systemctl` and `journalctl` for troubleshooting.
- Fixing broken services in Linux.
