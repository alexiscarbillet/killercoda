# ðŸŽ‰ Scenario Complete

Youâ€™ve completed the **Linux Disk Full: Log Management** scenario.

You learned how to:
- Check disk usage with `df`
- Locate large log files with `du`
- Free disk space by truncating or compressing logs
- Configure log rotation with `logrotate`

This skill is critical for Linux troubleshooting, especially in production environments where full disks can cause services to crash.

Great work!
