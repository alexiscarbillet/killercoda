# 🏁 Scenario Complete!

Congratulations! You have successfully mastered basic text transformation using the powerful `sed` command.

### Key Takeaways:

* **Substitution:** `sed 's/pattern/replacement/' file`
* **Deletion:** `sed '/pattern/d' file`
* **In-Place Editing:** You **must** use the **`-i`** flag to save changes back to the file. Without it, `sed` only prints to the screen.

You are now ready to handle more complex text manipulation tasks in your scripts and configuration management!
