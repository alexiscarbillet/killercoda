# 📄 Text Transformation with `sed`

Welcome to this hands-on scenario!

The Stream Editor (`sed`) is one of the most powerful utilities in Linux for transforming text. Unlike text editors like `vi` or `nano`, `sed` operates on a stream of text, making it perfect for non-interactive scripting and bulk operations.

### 🎯 Goal

By the end of this scenario, you will be able to:
* Create a multi-line file quickly using a **here-document**.
* Perform basic **text substitution** using the `s/` command.
* **Delete lines** based on a pattern.
* Make changes **permanent** using the `-i` (in-place) flag.
