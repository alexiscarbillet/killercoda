# Exploring and Mounting Disks in Linux

In this scenario, you’ll learn how to:
- List block devices and partitions.
- Mount a disk to a directory.
- Check mounted filesystems.
- Unmount a disk safely.

You’ll use the following commands:
- `lsblk` – list block devices
- `blkid` – display block device attributes
- `df -h` – show disk usage
- `mount` / `umount` – mount and unmount filesystems
- `mkdir` – create mount points

No issues or troubleshooting needed here — this scenario focuses purely on understanding how disk mounting works.
