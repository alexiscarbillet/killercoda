# SSH Security Concepts: An Audit Perspective

Instead of changing settings and risking a lockout, this scenario focuses on **Auditing**. You will learn how to inspect a running system, understand how SSH defaults work, and simulate what *would* happen if you tightened security.

### You will learn:
1. How to find active SSH settings that aren't in the config file.
2. The difference between `PermitRootLogin` values.
3. How to verify which ports are actually listening.
