# SSH Hardening & Security Audit

In this scenario, you are a System Administrator tasked with securing a fresh Ubuntu server. By default, SSH is often configured for compatibility rather than maximum security.

### Your Objectives:
1.  **Generate** an SSH Key pair.
2.  **Disable** root login and password-based authentication.
3.  **Change** the default SSH port to mitigate brute-force bots.
4.  **Configure** a firewall (UFW) to allow only necessary traffic.

Click **Start** to begin securing the system.
