# 🌐 Network Service Troubleshooting

Welcome! One of the most common tasks for a Linux administrator is diagnosing network issues, often starting with the question: **"Is the application running, and is it listening on the correct port?"**

This scenario will walk you through the diagnostic process using key network utilities: `ss`, `lsof`, and `nc`.

### 🎯 Goal

You will troubleshoot a simulated web service failure by:
* Identifying which process is running on a given port.
* Checking the network state using `ss`.
* Testing basic connectivity using `nc` (Netcat).
