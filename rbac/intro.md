# RBAC in Kubernetes

In this scenario, you will learn how to:
1. Create a namespace for isolation.
2. Create a ServiceAccount.
3. Create a Role with limited permissions (e.g., `get` and `list` pods only).
4. Bind the Role to the ServiceAccount.
5. Test allowed and forbidden actions.

This is essential for controlling access and following the principle of least privilege.
