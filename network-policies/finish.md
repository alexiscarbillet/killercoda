# ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

You successfully created and applied a Kubernetes NetworkPolicy.

In this scenario, you learned how to:
- Create isolated namespaces for testing
- Deploy pods in different namespaces
- Apply a NetworkPolicy to restrict traffic
- Test network restrictions

---

**Real-world tip:**  
Always test both allowed and denied cases after applying NetworkPolicies to ensure your configuration works as expected.
