# ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

You successfully performed a Kubernetes node maintenance operation.

In this scenario, you learned how to:
- Identify a specific node in the cluster
- Safely drain a node while ignoring DaemonSets
- Uncordon the node to make it schedulable again

---

**Real-world tip:**  
Before draining, always confirm whether workloads are using local storage or have disruption budgets â€” these can block eviction.  
After uncordoning, verify that pods are rescheduled and workloads are healthy.
