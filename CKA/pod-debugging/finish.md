# ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

You successfully debugged a faulty Kubernetes pod.

In this scenario, you learned how to:
- Identify pod issues using `kubectl describe` and `kubectl logs`
- Correct a container image reference
- Validate that the pod is healthy again

**Real-world tip:**  
Always check both the `Events` section of `kubectl describe` and the container logs â€” sometimes the issue is obvious in one but not the other.
