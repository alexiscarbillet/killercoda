# ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations!

You successfully created and used ConfigMaps and Secrets in Kubernetes.

In this scenario, you learned how to:
- Store non-sensitive and sensitive configuration separately
- Create a ConfigMap from literal values
- Create a Secret from literal values
- Inject them into a Pod as environment variables

---

**Real-world tip:**  
Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in YAML files. Use `kubectl create secret` or external secret management solutions to handle passwords securely.
